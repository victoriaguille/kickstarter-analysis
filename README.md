# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
###   An individual by the name of Louise has reached out for help reviewing Kickstarter data. She particularly wants to focus on any theater related items in the Kickstarter data as she is interested in launching her own Kickstarter for a play. The Kickstarter data was uploaded into Excel, ranging from an assortment of topics such as television to publishing to technology. In order to properly assist Louise, different measures were taken to appropriately categorize the needed data for review and display. Large chunks of the data went unused as categories were narrowed down and new charts or tables were created. Potential answers were summarized from these filtered results in order to best assist Louise in her endeavors.
