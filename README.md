# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
####  An individual by the name of Louise has reached out for help reviewing Kickstarter data. She particularly wants to focus on any theater related items in the Kickstarter data as she is interested in launching her own Kickstarter for a play. The Kickstarter data was uploaded into Excel, ranging from an assortment of topics such as television to publishing to technology. In order to properly assist Louise, different measures were taken to appropriately categorize the needed data for review and display. Large chunks of the data went unused as categories were narrowed down and new charts or tables were created. Potential answers were summarized from these filtered results in order to best assist Louise in her endeavors. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Launch Date Outcomes
#### Large portions of the Kickstarter data that has been provided could be considered useless as it does not pertain to theater focused topics. Louise specifically is looking at this data for her personal campaign plans, however, and the the numbers from the "launched_at" column can provide some useful insight regardless of what the Kickstarter campaign category is. With that in mind, a pivot chart was created from the Kickstarter sheet focused on looking at the years these campaigns were launched at, the success or failure of these campaigns, and the particular parent category. In order to better visualize the data, the pivot chart was filtered to only show the months and theater campaigns from the main Kickstarter data. From there the below line graph was created to showcase the information in an easier format. Looking at the below chart it is clear that the most successful theater Kickstarter campaigns started in May with 111 total over the years being a success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
####  goal amounts were important. created a new sheet with a new table of data using formulas to pull data from main kickstarter data. used a line graph to showcase data. typically, the higher the amount, the harder to fund. exception to every rule. with data provided, most success came from lower amounts ($5000 cap) ((insert goal chart)). there were no canceled campaigns in the entire data set. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####  lots of unnecessary data, perhaps not narrow enough for specific question. perhaps look at other sources for theater/play crowdfunding. ran into issues when creating new tables and charts if previous filtering was not cleared. resulted in not all info being pulled from the sheets. 
## Results
#### with the data provided, we can estimate a safe amount for successful kickstarter campaign. $5k or lower, launched during May. not a given as there is data showing failed campaigns at these amounts/time frame. could potentially use data from other crowdfunding sources to gain more data. narrow down the topics prior to acquiring data.
