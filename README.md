# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
####  An individual by the name of Louise has reached out for help reviewing Kickstarter data. She particularly wants to focus on any theater related items in the Kickstarter data as she is interested in launching her own Kickstarter for a play. The Kickstarter data was uploaded into Excel, ranging from an assortment of topics such as television to publishing to technology. In order to properly assist Louise, different measures were taken to appropriately categorize the needed data for review and display. Large chunks of the data went unused as categories were narrowed down and new charts or tables were created. Potential answers were summarized from these filtered results in order to best assist Louise in her endeavors. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Launch Date Outcomes
#### Large portions of the Kickstarter data that has been provided could be considered useless as it does not pertain to theater focused topics. Louise specifically is looking at this data for her personal campaign plans, however, and the the numbers from the "launched_at" column can provide some useful insight regardless of what the Kickstarter campaign category is. With that in mind, a pivot chart was created from the Kickstarter sheet focused on looking at the years these campaigns were launched at, the success or failure of these campaigns, and the particular parent category. In order to better visualize the data, the pivot chart was filtered to only show the months and theater campaigns from the main Kickstarter data. From there the below line graph was created to showcase the information in an easier format. Looking at the below chart it is clear that the most successful theater Kickstarter campaigns started in May with 111 total over the years being a success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
####  Goals are an important feature of any large scale project, yet it is hard to visualize the goal amounts in the original Kickstarter data sheet. In order to better understand the outcomes based on goals in the theater campaigns, a new sheet was created to then create a new table. The new table was split by ranges of money which were then broken down to show the number of outcomes per success, failure, and canceled. There were also rows added for the total amounts of each campaign within those predetermined ranges with percentages. All of this data was pulled from the main Kickstarter sheeet using precise formulas in each cell. Once the table was filled with the necessary information, a line graph was created to visualize these outcomes. Using specific filters on the line graph, it is clear to see in the below image that there is a correlation between success of a campaign and the goal amount. The graph also demonstrated that typically, the higher the amount, the harder to fund. However, there is always an exception to every rule. Another important factor that was clearly displayed in both the pivot chart and line graph, as seen below, there were no canceled campaigns in the entire data set.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####  At first glance, there are lots of pieces of unnecessary data in relation to Louise's particular question. If one were not well versed in coding raw research data, it might be impossible to properly come up with a solution. Overall, this could result in quite a challenge and it is even possible that the original questions prior to collecting the Kickstarter data was not narrow enough of questions. Aside from the initial collection of raw data, issues did occur when attempting to create new pivot charts from the existing data. Numbers were not matching up between the different outcome options. It was later discovered this occurred due to improper filters being applied to the Kickstarter sheet, but was easily fixed by clearing all filters on that specific sheet. This problem could potentially reoccur if the filters are not removed prior to creating new sheets in Excel.  
## Results
#### With the current data provided, a successful theater campaign using Kickstarter can be planned by Louise. The best time for Louise to launch her campaign according to the data, would be May. However, it is ideal to keep in mind that nearly a third of the theater campaigns launched in May were also failures. Louise will need to be mindful of the goal she is going to be setting in order to ensure the highest rate of success. Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goals line graph suggests that the safer range Louise would want to fall within can be no higher than $5,000. Despite the success previous theater campaigns had within these parameters, it cannot be guaranteed that Louise's campaign will succeed. If she wanted a better launch timeframe and success rate, a graph using the entire spreadsheet of Kickstarter data would be a good start. The data on theater campaigns in general is arguably rather limited compared to the other categories that were pulled from Kickstarter in this data set. Louise may be able to have a firmer chance of success pulling data specifically for theater campaigns from several crowdfunding sources online and narrowing down her topic.
